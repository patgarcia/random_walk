# random_walk

A random walk script just for fun. Built after 'HarvardX: PH526x Using Python for Research' course in EdX. [2.4.5 module]

It uses numpy to create a normal distribution of k steps and calculates the cumulative sum between steps for each dimension.

It returns a random variable X with origin 0 that gets plotted as a visual aid of the generated random walk.
